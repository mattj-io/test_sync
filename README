Python script to update Content Index board tasks in Asana with the tags that are in production in WP.

Set your ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable to a Personal Access Token obtained in your Asana Account Settings
eg. export ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=my_access_token

Creates an output log ( output.log ) containing time stamps from the previous run, and will only update tasks modified since the last run

Any URL's which are not correct will also be logged to this file

If you want to re-create all tags, just delete the output log and re-run
